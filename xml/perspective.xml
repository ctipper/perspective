      <introduction>
         <p>This is a demonstration of the ::perspective stylesheets. It is not a 
         comprehensive collection at present, merely implementing those markup 
         elements that are needed to support general article semantics, such as 
         footnotes, bibliography support, lists of various types, tables and image 
         inclusion.</p>
         <p>New elements will be added as and when required.</p>

      <a name="Thuc01"></a><p class="text-muted"><sup>6.8</sup> At the beginning of  
      spring 415 BC the Athenian delegation returned from Sicily. They brought with 
      them the Egestaeans and sixty talents of uncoined silver, a months pay for 
      sixty triremes and their supplies.</p>
      <p class="text-muted">The Athenians held an assembly and heard the Egestaeans 
      and their own envoys. It was reported that there were large quantities of 
      money in the treasury and the temples, and they voted to send sixty ships 
      under the command of three generals, Alcibiades, Nicias and Lamachus. They 
      were appointed with full powers and given orders to help the Egestaeans 
      against the Selinuntines, to restore Leontini subsequent to victory and act 
      in the best interests of Athens with regard to further action in Sicily.

      <p>In practice, the distinction between noosphere and ergosphere is not 
      important for the purposes of this paper. It is dubious whether the 
      <sq>noosphere</sq> in the pure sense Fare insists on can be said to exist in 
      any meaningful way; one would almost have to be a Platonist philosopher to 
      believe in it. And the distinction between noosphere and ergosphere is only 
      of <i>practical </i>importance if one wishes to assert that ideas (the 
      elements of the noosphere) cannot be owned, but their instantiations as 
      projects can.</p>
      <p class="font-italic">To avoid confusion, however, it is important to 
      note that neither the noosphere nor the ergosphere is the same as the 
      totality of virtual locations in electronic media that is sometimes called 
      <sq>cyberspace</sq>. Property there is regulated by completely different 
      rules that are closer to those of the material substratum&mdash;essentially, 
      he who owns the media and machines on which a part of <sq>cyberspace</sq> is 
      hosted owns that piece of cyberspace as a result.</p>
